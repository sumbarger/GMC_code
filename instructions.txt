How to use a git repository:
Make a clone of repository by entering "git clone git@github.com:sumbarger/GMC_code.git ~"location
The location is where you want the repository

Before you start typing, you need to enter "git pull origin main"
This is important to do otherwise it could lead to conflicts
This will pull the file from the remote repository
Then you enter your message
After adding message, type "git add" and then "git commit"
Then you will need to send it back and save changes to the remote repository
To do this you enter "git push origin main"

Some helpful commands:
"git diff" shows the difference between previous commited and version just made
"git diff --staged" shows the difference after "git add" was completed
"git log" shows when each version was commited along with the commit ID
This also includes the message typed with "git commit"
"git diff HEAD" shows you previous commits
"git checkout" restores previous verisons 
To do this you need the commit ID
