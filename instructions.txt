HOW TO CLONE A GITHUB REPOSITORY:
First create an empty folder in the desired location of your computer (this is step is optional as you can just let git clone the repository in your User and then manually move it around) 
Make a clone of repository by entering "git clone git@github.com:sumbarger/GMC_code.git *location*"
Replace *location* with the name of the created folder or leave it out if you don't have one 

MAKING EDITS:
Before you start making edits, you should always navagate to the repository folder via the terminal and enter "git pull origin main" 
This is to ensure that your version of the repository is up to date
This is important to do otherwise it could lead to conflicts
This will pull the file from the remote repository
Once you have made edits to a file, navigate to its location via terminal and type "git add *file name here*"
this will add edits to a queue on github which can be commited by the repository owner
you can commit the changes yourself by typing: git commit *file name here -m"Put your message here" 
your message should include a brief description of the changes you have made to the edited file(s)
Then you will need to send it back and save changes to the remote repository
To do this you enter "git push origin main"

Note- It would be a good idea to memorize the pattern of editing a repository: pull, add, commit, push

Some helpful commands:
"git diff" shows the difference between previous commited and version just made
"git diff --staged" shows the difference after "git add" was completed
"git log" shows when each version was commited along with the commit ID
This also includes the message typed with "git commit"
"git diff HEAD" shows you previous commits
"git checkout" restores previous verisons 
To do this you need the commit ID
